## Gaussian Fourier Pyramid for Local Laplacian Filter

The optimized code for the paper is publishd in the part of my library [OpenCP](https://github.com/norishigefukushima/OpenCP).
The detail part is [here](https://github.com/norishigefukushima/OpenCP/tree/master/MultiScaleFilter).

The code published on OpenCP is heavily optimized, i.e., less readable. 
Therefore this page also provides readable codes.
If you need faster operation, please use the code in the OpenCP project.
