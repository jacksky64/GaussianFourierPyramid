## Gaussian Fourier Pyramid for Local Laplacian Filter

The optimized code for the paper is published in the part of my library [OpenCP](https://github.com/norishigefukushima/OpenCP).
The detail part for this paper is [here](https://github.com/norishigefukushima/OpenCP/tree/master/MultiScaleFilter).

However, the code published on OpenCP is heavily optimized, i.e., less readable. 
Therefore this page also provides readable codes: C++ header only code and Python implementation.
The header only code has about 500 lines, while the optimized code has 15000+ lines.

If you need faster operation, please use the code in the OpenCP project.

* [header only C++](./GaussianFourierPyramid/LLF.hpp)
    * The sln file is for the project of header only C++.
* Python
    * under construction.
